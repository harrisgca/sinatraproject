#Quick Reddit

**This project is in no way affiliated with [Reddit](http://reddit.com)**

I browse Reddit alot. I wanted to combine my love for Reddit with some web technologies that I'm learning:

- Sinatra
- jQuery
- JSON parsing
- APIs

This is a one-page application that makes a GET request to Reddit's API (r/nba, r/nfl, and r/soccer) and displays the formatted result.
